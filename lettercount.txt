gets( sentence);// Get sentence from the user

while ( i< len)// while i is smaller than 0
{(diff = sentence[i] -97); // i - 97 to work out values from the keyboartd into simple numbers

alpha [diff] ++;// Here it takes the value figured out by using archemtic table and adds one to the total found in the sentence

i++;// increae adds one to i so it moves it the next charcter
}

for(i=0; i<26; i++)// Will runt he loops for all the letter in the alphebete

printf("%c, %d\n", 97 + i, alpha[i
it can tell you how many of each type of letter are in a word
as a is 97 b is 98 ect ...
